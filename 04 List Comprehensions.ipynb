When working with lists, they essentially allow for a block of code that would take several lines to be condensed to a one-liner.\n\nSo, when creating a list, we can generally do it in a single line. Let’s see a simple example of this.\n\nWe have a list with numbers and we want to make another list based on that. Although this example is not practical, it illustrated what list comprehensions are. To see the difference and why comprehensions are useful, first block code will show how we would do this “the old fashioned way”.\n"
